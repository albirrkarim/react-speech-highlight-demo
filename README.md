# Introduction

Recently, i want to implement the text-to-speech task to my website. Then i search on the internet. but i can't find the library or npm package to solve all my problems. I just want some powerfull package that work on all platforms.

The [SpeechSynthesis](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis) comes with problems (See [PROBLEM.md](https://github.com/albirrkarim/react-speech-highlight-demo/blob/main/PROBLEM.md))

# B. TODO

- Give API output: The html element for highlighted sentence and word. This can be benefiting when you play with web metaverse. imagine some Text-To-Speech in metaverse. (mozilla hubs, aframe, etc)
- Let me know what you want from this package, please write it on issues tab
- Automate the testing
